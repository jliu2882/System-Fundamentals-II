 * @brief  Perform data compression.

 *
 * Data is read byte-by-byte from stdin, and each group of one or two
 * bytes is interpreted as a single "symbol" (according to whether
 * the BYTES field of the global_options variable is 1 or 2).
 * Multi-byte symbols are constructed according to "big-endian" byte order:
 * the first byte read is used as the most-significant byte of the symbol
 * and the last byte becomes the least-significant byte.  The "move-to-front"
 * transform is used to map each symbol read to its current rank.
 * As described in the assignment handout, the range of possible ranks is
 * twice the size of the input alphabet.  For example, 1-byte input symbols
 * have values in the range [0, 255] and their ranks have values in the
 * range [0, 511].  Ranks in the lower range are used for symbols that have
 * already been encountered in the input, and ranks in the upper range
 * serve as default ranks for symbols that have not yet been seen.
 *
 * Once a symbol has been mapped to a rank r, Fibonacci coding is applied
 * to the value r+1 (which will therefore always be a positive integer)
 * to obtain a corresponding code word (conceptually, a sequence of bits).
 * The successive code words obtained as each symbol is read are concatenated
 * and the resulting bit string is blocked into 8-bit bytes (according to
 * "big-endian" bit order).  These 8-bit bytes are written successively to
 * stdout.
 *
 * When the end of input is reached, any partial output byte is "padded"
 * with 0 bits in the least-signficant positions to reach a full 8-bit
 * byte, which is emitted as the final byte in the output.
 *
 * Note that the transformation performed by this function is to be done
 * in an "online" fashion: output is produced incrementally as input is read,
 * without having to read the entire input first.
 * Note also that this function does *not* attempt to "close" its input

 * of symbols that have previously been seen.  Using this interpretation,
