/**
 * @brief  Perform data compression.
 * @details  Read uncompressed data from stdin and write the corresponding
 * compressed data to stdout, using the "move-to-front" transform and
 * Fibonacci coding, as described in the assignment handout.
 *
 * Data is read byte-by-byte from stdin, and each group of one or two
 * bytes is interpreted as a single "symbol" (according to whether
 * the BYTES field of the global_options variable is 1 or 2).
 * Multi-byte symbols are constructed according to "big-endian" byte order:
 * the first byte read is used as the most-significant byte of the symbol
 * and the last byte becomes the least-significant byte.  The "move-to-front"
 * transform is used to map each symbol read to its current rank.
 * As described in the assignment handout, the range of possible ranks is
 * twice the size of the input alphabet.  For example, 1-byte input symbols
 * have values in the range [0, 255] and their ranks have values in the
 * range [0, 511].  Ranks in the lower range are used for symbols that have
 * already been encountered in the input, and ranks in the upper range
 * serve as default ranks for symbols that have not yet been seen.
 *
 * Once a symbol has been mapped to a rank r, Fibonacci coding is applied
 * to the value r+1 (which will therefore always be a positive integer)
 * to obtain a corresponding code word (conceptually, a sequence of bits).
 * The successive code words obtained as each symbol is read are concatenated
 * and the resulting bit string is blocked into 8-bit bytes (according to
 * "big-endian" bit order).  These 8-bit bytes are written successively to
 * stdout.
 *
 * When the end of input is reached, any partial output byte is "padded"
 * with 0 bits in the least-signficant positions to reach a full 8-bit
 * byte, which is emitted as the final byte in the output.
 *
 * Note that the transformation performed by this function is to be done
 * in an "online" fashion: output is produced incrementally as input is read,
 * without having to read the entire input first.
 * Note also that this function does *not* attempt to "close" its input
 * or output streams.
 *
 * @return 0 if the operation completes without error, -1 otherwise.

/**
 * @brief  Perform data decompression, inverting the transformation performed
 * by mtf_encode().
 * @details Read compressed data from stdin and write the corresponding
 * uncompressed data to stdout, inverting the transformation performed by
 * mtf_encode().
 *
 * Data is read byte-by-byte from stdin and is parsed into individual
 * Fibonacci code words, using the fact that two consecutive '1' bits can
 * occur only at the end of a code word.  The terminating '1' bits are
 * discarded and the remaining bits are interpreted as describing the set
 * of terms in the Zeckendorf sum representing a positive integer.
 * The value of the sum is computed, and one is subtracted from it to
 * recover a rank.  Ranks in the upper half of the range of possible values
 * are interpreted as the default ranks of symbols that have not yet been
 * seen, and ranks in the lower half of the range are interpreted as ranks
 * of symbols that have previously been seen.  Using this interpretation,
 * together with the ranking information maintained by the "move-to-front"
 * heuristic, the rank is decoded to obtain a symbol value.  Each symbol
 * value is output as a sequence of one or two bytes (using "big-endian" byte
 * order), according to the value of the BYTES field in the global_options
 * variable.
 *
 * Any 0 bits that occur as padding after the last code word are discarded
 * and do not contribute to the output.
 * 
 * Note that (as for mtf_encode()) the transformation performed by this
 * function is to be done in an "online" fashion: the entire input need not
 * (and should not) be read before output is produced.
 * Note also that this function does *not* attempt to "close" its input
 * or output streams.
 *
 * @return 0 if the operation completes without error, -1 otherwise.
