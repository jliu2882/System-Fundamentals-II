/*

Once pipeline set, cook use wait/waitpid to wait for pipeline processes and determine success(exit(0) AND no signal)
on success, go to next task; on fail, exit(EXIT_FAILURE) || if all tasks in recipe done; exit(0)

main process wait for recipes 23/6; it must be waiting for signal when cook ends
sigaction() syscall to install handler for SIGCHLD
    handler invoked->examine exit status
        0->mark recipe as completed
       !0->mark recipe as failed
    if success, do the dfs agane (tldr; what im doing in process but might need to move the codes)

processing loop and SIGCHLD handler are concurrent flow that access same data struct
    //main loop must BLOCK execution of handler during times it accesses data struct
        //use sigprocmask()
Main program should not exit until it has reaped all existing child processes.
Mark recipes with failure(-1 in state->complete) so we can catch failures and exit program asap
